// Use Bully algorithm to implement a working version of replica synchronization.
// You may assume that
//  1. each replica maintains some data structure (that may diverge for arbitrary reasons),
//     which are periodically synchronized with the coordinator.
//  2. The coordinator initiates the synchronization process by sending message to all other machines.
//  3. Upon receiving the message from the coordinator, each machine updates its local version of the
//     data structure with the coordinatorâ€™s version.
//  4. The coordinator, being an arbitrary machine in the network, is subject to fault. Thus,
//     4.1 a new coordinator is chosen by the Bully algorithm.
//     4.2	You can assume a fixed timeout to simulate the behaviour of detecting a fault
//     The objective is to have a consensus across all machines (simulated by GO routines)
//     in terms of the newly elected coordinator.
